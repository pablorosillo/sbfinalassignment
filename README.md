Programs used in the development of Systems Biology final project, all written by me in Python.

This repository includes

- The [motif counter](<motifcounter.py>),
- the [program for removing repeated edges](<removerepeatededges.py>), a phenomena which caused probems detecting subgraphs and using Uri Alon's program, and
- the [program for removing self-loops](<removeselfloops.py>).
